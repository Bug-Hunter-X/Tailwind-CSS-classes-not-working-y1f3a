# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with Tailwind CSS: the failure of Tailwind directives to apply styles correctly. 

## Problem Description

The provided code snippet includes a div element with Tailwind classes for background color (`bg-red-500`) and hover effect (`hover:bg-blue-700`). Despite following Tailwind's setup and build process, the browser ignores these classes, resulting in no styling applied to the element.

## Solution

The solution often involves verifying several key aspects of the Tailwind CSS configuration and implementation.

1. **Configuration File:** Ensure that the `tailwind.config.js` file (or the equivalent in your framework) is correctly configured to include the paths to your template files. This tells Tailwind where to look for the classes being used in your project.
2. **Build Process:** Verify that the Tailwind directives are being processed correctly by your build process (e.g., Webpack, Vite, etc.). This step involves compiling the Tailwind CSS into a stylesheet that your HTML file can use.
3. **Class Names:** Double-check the spelling of the class names, case sensitivity, and make sure that the correct class names are used in your HTML.
4. **CSS Order:** The order of your CSS files or the use of `!important` in other CSS styles can sometimes override Tailwind styles.  Review your stylesheet order and resolve any potential conflicts.
5. **Purge Configuration:** If you are using Tailwind's purge feature (now `content` option in newer versions), make sure that the paths to your template files are accurately specified.  Incorrectly configured purging can strip out classes that should be included.
6. **Browser Caching:** In some rare cases, browser caching can cause older, unstyled versions of your CSS file to be used. Try hard-refreshing or clearing your browser's cache to resolve this.

By carefully reviewing these points, you can resolve most issues related to Tailwind classes not functioning correctly.
